CSE 230 project - Hoogle Docs (Google docs in Haskell)
## Overview
In this project, we aim to implement a subset of the Google Docs functionality on Haskell using the [brick](https://github.com/jtdaugherty/brick/) library interface. 
## Goals
We have 3 primary goals:
  1. Shared Editing - Using this feature, multiple users can edit the document synchronously. We will implement the shared interface using websockets.
  2. Commenting - This feature enables any user to select a portion of text in the editor and leave a comment that can be viewed by all users. The owner of the document can mark a comment as resolved, if they choose to, thereby closing the comment.
  3. Track Changes - This feature allows users to look at the history of the document, including edits, and whom the edits were made by along with timestamps for the same. This feature also allows the owner of the document to restore any previous version of the document. Historical document versions will also contain the comments left in previous versions (ambitious).
  4. (Ambitious) Editing and Suggesting modes - If time permits, we will also try to implement a separate suggest mode in the document. This feature would enable a user to suggest changes in the document, which can be accepted or rejected by the owner of the document.
## Limitations
Due to the large scope of the project, we will be consciously cutting back on some Google Doc functionality. Some significant limitations include:
  1. User roles - In our version of the project, each document will have a single owner who can perform document restorations, and (if implemented) accept and reject suggestions. Additionally, the owner will have the ability to resolve and close comments. We may not have the time to implement different user roles, such as Editors and Viewers. Therefore, all users will be able to edit, and comment on a document that they are added to.
  2. Editor GUI - The editor GUI and capabilities may not be as rich as the Google Docs interface due to time constraints. With shared editing and document history as our central goal, we will attempt to make the editor as nice as possible.

### Redefined Goals
Based on the above challenges, we have decided to limit our scope to the following:
1. Single Document Owner and Multiple Viewers - Each document will have a single owner who can edit it. All other clients can only view the file. We are currently attempting to allow viewer clients to be able to watch as the owner edits a document in real time, but if that is not possible, viewer clients will be able to view files once the owner saves the file.
2. Commenting and Tracking Changes - Given the time contraints, we have decided that implementing commenting and tracking changes is not feasible. If time permits, we will try to implement functionality for these features.

### Challenges
  1. Network: We started our implementation based on the "Implement a chat server on Haskell" wiki. We used this code as a reference to understand network and socket programming in Haskell. We realized that in this implementation, the server and client tasks were clubbed under common methods. In order to be able to create clients with different privileges (such as document owners, and document viewers), we separated the client and server functionalities into separate modules. We plan on using this as the basis of displaying a text editor TUI for each client. Our current task is to define owner privileges for a single client.
  2. Editor: To design our editor, we used a brick based text editor implementation <insert link>. We plan on keeping the interface fairly simple as our core task is to implement shared editing. We plan on extending this simple editor to add a few more basic functionalities that the editor does not currently support. For example, the text editor currently does not support shifting the cursor to the next line while pressing the right key at the end of a line. Additionally, the document border in the editor adjusts in size as the user types into it. We plan on providing static document page borders which is visually more appealing.
