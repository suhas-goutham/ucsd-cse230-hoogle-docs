1. Multiple keypress -> single action event
2. Viewer who joins midway starts at owner TUI's cursor state (pass owner's ts to viewer maybe?)
3. Fix exit issues
4. Club all TUI code in one separate file - Viewer and Owner have different handleEvent functions
5. Menus - Each doc needs an owner field
6. Fix quit
